This is a web interface that connects to Facebook, Google+ Calendar Events, and Meetup API in order to grab user data with regards to their query, and render it via browser. 

Languages used are Javascript, Python, HTML, PHP, and CSS. 

Facebook API was accessed and rendered using pure Javascript/HTML/CSS.

Google+ Calendar API was accessed and rendered using pure Javascript/HTML/CSS.

Meetup.com API was accessed and (somewhat rendered) using Javascript/HTML/CSS/Python/PHP.
    
    In order to access Meetup.com API, two processes were explored, one of which leading to a result in PHP.
    
    1) Querying the HTTP 'GET' request with XHP in Javascript, this wasn't allowed because of issues dealing
       with CORS, therefore the second option was resorted to.
       
    2) Querying the HTTP 'GET' request with Python allowed for the xml page rendered to be saved and 
       parsed wth xml.doc that is a Python built-in library. This library allowed to extract important xml
       data, with which I wrote out to a file. In order to get the URL to Python, I decided to use PHP to get the data
       of the URL from an HTML DOM object and write it out to file which Python will read.
       
       The file <meetupData.txt> contains the information needed to be displayed on the HTML page, in which case
       Javascript is used to read and render.
